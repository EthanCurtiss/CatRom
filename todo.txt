CatRom:

Length
Improve accuracy of splineAlpha in AlphaToSpline

Spline:

Better handling of consecutive equal points
	Consider now that you have to find at least two unequal points to calculate
	the zeroth and veryLast points

Better numerical integration
Uniform reparameterization

Future:

Support modifying a single point
Support number splines
Restrict SolveBinormal, SolveCFrame, and SolveRotCFrame to the appropriate types

Way way future:

Support adding and removing points
