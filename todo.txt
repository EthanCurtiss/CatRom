[Repo]

* Proper documentation

[CatRom]

* Improve accuracy of splineAlpha in :AlphaToSpline()

[Spline]

* Faster and more precise numerical integration for :SolveLength()
* Add uniform reparameterization and accompanying methods

[Future]

* Support modifying points (important for avoiding re-instantiating every frame)
* Support adding and removing points
* n-dimensional splines (already possible with vector CatRoms but annoying to do)
